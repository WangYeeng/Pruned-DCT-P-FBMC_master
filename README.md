abstract = {Filter Bank Multi-Carrier modulation based on Offset Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (FBMC-OQAM) provides superior spectral properties than Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). However, the compatibility of FBMC-OQAM with OFDM in many techniques faces great challenges. In this paper, we present a Pruned Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) Precoding based FBMC (Pruned DCT-p-FBMC) modulation, which inherits the advantages of FBMC-OQAM as well as Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access and realizes the technical compatibility between FBMC and OFDM. Specifically, considering the anti-interference ability of symbols, we first use pruned DCT to spread them into frequency domain, thus reducing the interference between adjacent symbols. Secondly, we calculate the signal-to-interference ratio and the signal-to-interference-to-noise ratio to assess the impact of residual interference on the system. Finally, the Log-Likelihood Ratio is calculated so that Turbo coding in Pruned DCT-p-FBMC is implemented. Additionally, we provide throughput calculations for evaluating the performance of channel coding and link adaptation. Simulation results show that Pruned DCT-p-FBMC exhibits robust MIMO transmission capabilities along with considerable throughput.}
